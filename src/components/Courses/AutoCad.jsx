            <h3>What is AutoCAD?</h3>
            <p>
              AutoCAD is a computer-aided design (CAD) software used by
              architects, engineers, and construction professionals to create
              precise 2D and 3D drawings. It provides tools for drafting,
              annotation, and modeling, enabling the creation of detailed
              architectural plans, mechanical parts, and complex structures. Key
              features include layers for organizing drawings, blocks for
              reusable content, and external references for collaborative work.
              AutoCAD also supports 3D modeling and rendering, allowing users to
              visualize their designs in three dimensions.
