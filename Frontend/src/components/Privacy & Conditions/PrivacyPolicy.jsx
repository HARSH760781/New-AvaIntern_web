          <p>
            We may obtain your consent to collect and use certain types of
            Personal Data when we are required to do so by law. Once consent is
            obtained from the individual to use his or her information for those
            purposes, Ava Intern has the individual’s implied consent to collect
            or receive any supplementary information that is necessary to
            fulfill the same purposes. Express consent will also be obtained if,
            or when, a new use is identified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consent may also be implied where a user is given notice and a
            reasonable opportunity to opt-out of his or her personal information
            being used for mail-outs, the marketing of new services or products,
            and the client, customer, member does not opt-out. Subject to
            certain exceptions (e.g., the personal information is necessary to
            provide the service or product, or the withdrawal of consent would
            frustrate the performance of a legal obligation), individuals can
            withhold or withdraw their consent for Ava Intern to use their
            personal information in certain ways.

            accordance with this privacy policy and our Terms of Use.

          <p>
            If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to
            provide us with any required Personal Data, we may not be able to
            provide you the services that can be offered on our company.

          <p>
            All fees paid for our live and recorded courses are non-refundable.
            Once you have made a payment for a course, it is considered final
            and cannot be refunded. This policy is in place to maintain the
            quality and sustainability of our services and to ensure that our
            instructors and team can continue to provide valuable learning
            experiences to all our students.

            or job is subject to various factors beyond our control, including
            your skills, performance, and market conditions. We do not guarantee
            internship or job placement upon course completion.

            connection meet the technical requirements necessary to access our
            courses effectively. We cannot provide refunds due to technical
            limitations on your end.
          </p>

            experience that can help students to achieve their goals. We also
            believe that it is important for students to be able to explore
            different options and find the program that is right for them.
